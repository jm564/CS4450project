## How to use

3. (Optional) If you want to create a .png, you will need to install GraphViz to your Python environment, and then use 'dot -Tpng parse_tree.dot -o parse_tree.png' in an ubuntu/wsl terminal (you may need to also install the ubuntu pkg for GraphViz as well, which can be found at https://www.graphviz.org/download/, you can also find other compatible versions as well)
